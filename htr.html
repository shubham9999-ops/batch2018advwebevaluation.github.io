<br>The Shillong Airport is located in Umroi, around 40 km from the heart of the city and is also known as Barapani Air Force Base or Umroi Airport.
 It is a very small airport and has flights that are operated by Indian Airlines that run only to/from Kolkata on certain days in a week.
 However, the flights to Umroi are generally cancelled at the last minute due to adverse weather conditions. 
Due to this, the airport in Guwahati is a much better option.
 Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport in Guwahati is located 104 km from Shillong and is connected to other cities in India such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, etc. and also to other north-eastern cities.
 These cities are well-connected via Air India, IndiGo, Jet Airways, Vistara, etc. 
Until now, international flights in the Guwahati airport are limited to Paro in Bhutan and Bangkok in Thailand, via Druk Air. 
One can take the shared cabs, always available outside the Guwahati airport and reach Shillong in 3 hours.<<br><br><br>

<h2 style="color:deeppink">Nearest Airport:</h2><br>Umroi Airport is located in Umroi, 40 kms away from the city of Shillong.
 Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport is located in Borjhar, in the city of Guwahati and serves as a better option to connect to Shillong.
 This airport also serves as a base for the Indian Air Force and is managed by Airports Authority of India.<br><br><br>

<h2 style="color:deeppink">Safety Suggestion:</h2><br>Usually, there are no reports of adverse weather conditions and weather-related issues for flight landings at Guwahati Airport.
 However, a thick blanket of fog covers the city during the winter season. 
This can cause delays in flight schedules, though such instances happen rarely.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<div id="bus" class="tabcontent" style="background-color:white">
<br><br><br>For Shillong, the main interstate bus stand is located in the city of Guwahati and the buses are run by the Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) and Meghalaya Transport Corporation (MTC). Two major highways pass through Shillong, NH 40, connecting the city to Guwahati and NH 44 that connects the city to Tripura. Privately run buses also connect the two cities of Shillong and Guwahati and the service is economical. The private buses are in better condition but occasionally crowded and have comparatively more stops en route. The journey usually takes 4 hours. A major private bus operator is Jagannath Travels And Tour Pvt Ltd.
			<br><br><h2 style="color:deeppink">Journey Suggestion:</h2><br>Since Shillong is a hill station, winding paths run through the hills. The roads are smooth and are in good condition all around the city. A bus journey is smooth and the roads provide a comfortable tour.</b>

<div id="train" class="tabcontent" style="background-color:white">
				<br><br><br>There is no railway connectivity in Meghalaya. However, the nearest railway station is Guwahati, which is located 105 km from Shillong and is well-connected with all the major cities of India such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, etc. Ordinary trains as well as A/C trains and superfast express trains operate from here. Some of these trains are Dibrugarh-Rajdhani Express, Guwahati-Bangalore Express, etc.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
